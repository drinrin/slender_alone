# Overview
The player finds himself/herself in the middle of a secluded dark forest with only a flashlight in hand. <br>
They must navigate through the area to find out what happened to the missing people/children. <br>
Clues were spread out in the forest and these may also serve as the key to escape.<br>
Is the player alone in this dark forest or is the perpetrator lurking around?<br>
One thing is for sure, we are not alone.
