A Slender Game created using Unity

# Overview
The player finds himself/herself in the middle of a secluded dark forest with only a flashlight in hand.
They must navigate through the area to find out what happened to the missing people/children.
Clues were spread out in the forest and these may also serve as the key to escape.
Is the player alone in this dark forest or is the perpetrator lurking around?
One thing is for sure, we are not alone.

# My first self-taught unity project
This game serves as my creation to learn more about Unity and is free to download.
